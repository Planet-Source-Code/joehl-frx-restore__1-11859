## FRX Restore\.


</div>

### Description

Ever have an old program that you backed up the .FRMs\FRXs to, and suddenly notice that you need the pictures that where on that form. I bet its the worse feeling in the world, right up there with getting dumped. But wait! There is a light! FRX Restore will take that old dirty FRX File and turn it back into there old picture files! Pick and choose what pictures get extracted from the FRX data.
 
### More Info
 
you need to tell it the location of a FRX File.

Small amounts of file I\O. I have fully remarked out my code so it should be a breeze.

It returns a vuable picture, this picture can also be saved to a normal file.

It will allways create a small image file in your root dir (C:\)
